# CSE-482-Lab
I will upload some basic project using HTML, CSS, JS, PHP.

And bytehost will be our domain server.

Week 1 just a overview of html and css.

<b>Highly recommended to learn from w3school.</b>

### Lab task 1 :
          Create your portfolio page using HTML and CSS.
          
N.B: Using third party elements is strictly provided. 

So I made a fake portfolio using html and css.

<b>note: any type of framework can not be used in this session. Only Raw code will be here.</b>

### Lab Task 2 :

          Create a registration form using PHP HTML CSS.
         
N.B: Using third party elements is strictly provided. 

Here Normal html code will show the result in php file.

I use md5() to hash my password and protect it.

Check the code if you want to.

No one can access the inspect element view as I turned off context menu.

Have Fun !
